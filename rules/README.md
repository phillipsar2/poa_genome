Consensus ETS sequences for the pop panel Poa
(1) Reads for each individual were mapped to KJ599036.1.fasta, bams were sorted, duplicatees were marked, and read groups were added.  
(2) SNPs were called with gatk HaplotypeCaller, SNPs were pulled out and hard filtered following GATK best practices. 
(3) The vcfs were then use to generate a pseduo sequence with gatk FastaAlternateReferenceMaker.
