## Project organization

Analyses are organizing into three subdirectories:

1. poa_pop_gen: Workflow for the phylogenetic species validation, analysis of genetic diversity, and evaluation of population structure of the Poa pratensis population panel.
2. assembly: Workflow for genome assembly and assessment of assembly.
3. annotation: Workflow for the gene and repetitive element annotations and assesment of annotation quality..

## Data availability
The genome assembly and annotation are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under BioProject PRJEB51672. 
The raw Illumina sequence data for the Poa population panel is available from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID PRJNA730042.
