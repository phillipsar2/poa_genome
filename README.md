## Project organization

Analyses are organizing into three subdirectories:

1. `assembly`: Workflow for genome assembly and assessment of assembly.
2. `annotation`: Workflow for the gene and repetitive element annotations and assesment of annotation quality.
3. `poa_pop_gen`: Workflow for the phylogenetic species validation, analysis of genetic diversity, and evaluation of population structure of the Poa pratensis population panel.

## Data availability
The genome assembly and annotation are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under BioProject [PRJEB51672](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51672). 
The raw Illumina sequence data for the Poa population panel is available from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID [PRJNA730042](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA730042/).
